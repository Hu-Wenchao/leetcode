"""
For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose 
any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. 
Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are 
called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a 
function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels
