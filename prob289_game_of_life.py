According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, 
also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised 
by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial 
state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its 
eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the 
following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if 
caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on 
to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, 
as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a 
live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) 
of the board given its current state.
